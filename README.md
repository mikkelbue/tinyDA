# tinyDA
Delayed Acceptance MCMC sampler with finite-length subchain sampling. 
This is intended as a simple, lightweight implementation, with minimal dependencies, e.g. nothing beyond the SciPy stack.

### This is very much a work in progress.

## Proposals
* Random Walk Metropolis Hastings (RWMH)
* preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN)
* Adaptive Metropolis (AM)
* Adaptive pCN

## Adaptive Error Models
* State independent
* State dependent
